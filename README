Implementations of fast randomized algorithms for computing the approximate low rank SVD of a matrix. 
A \approx U_k \Sigma_k V^T_k
See the included pdf file (in description/ folder) for a more detailed description.
There are three codes: for single processor (with GNU GSL), multiprocessor 
(with Intel MKL) and GPU (with CULA library for NVIDIA CUDA capable cards).

Written by Sergey Voronin, 2014
Tested with GSL-1.16, icc/mkl 14.03, cuda/cula 6.0

============ summary of installation and usage ==============

One must install the GSL development libraries, intel mkl (and the intel C compiler), 
and the CULA Dense packages. Please refer to their responding documentations.
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl
http://www.culatools.com/dense/

Each implementation resides in its own subfolder with a compile.sh file. After 
necessary paths (PATH variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are set for referencing 
gsl, mkl, and cuda/cula, this file 
should be modified to reflect any local system changes and executed to yield the 
driver executable in each case. Paths for mkl are usually set via:
$ source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
For cuda/cula, source the script nvidia_gpu_cula_code/setup_paths.sh after checking 
that the paths are correct for your system.  

In order to make a test matrix, use the provide make_matrix_binary.m script which can be run 
from Octave or Matlab. Note that this script writes a binary matrix file.

Once the matrix is made one can use any of the drivers to compute the low 
rank SVD. Inside the main loop of the programs one sets the rank k <= min(nrows,ncols).

One can call either algorithm I,II, or III for computing the low rank SVD with each driver.
Single core code currently supports only I and II.

Notice that for the multiprocessor OpenMP based code, one can control the number of 
threads used via an environmental variable. For instance, in bash type:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
to use 6 threads. You should use as many threads as there are physical cores for 
best results, but the optimal configuration differs for different systems.

Example run with GPU code

First, make the matrix
$ octave
> more off;
> make_matrix_binary 
> ls data/A_mat1.bin
$

Check to make sure nvidia libs are setup ok:
$ nvidia-smi 

Switch to correct directory
$ cd nvidia_gpu_cula_code 

Source paths to cuda/cula
$ source setup_paths.sh

Compile
$./compile.sh

Run:
$./driver_gpu_nvidia_cula
