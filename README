RSVDPACK: Implementations of fast algorithms for computing the low rank SVD, 
interpolative and CUR decompositions, using randomized sampling. 
Given, a real mxn matrix A and a rank parameter 
k<< min(m,n) (or optionally, a tolerance parameter instead of rank) the 
rsvd routines compute  
U_k, Sigma_k, and V_k
where U_k is mxk, Sigma_k is kxk, and V_k is nxk, such that:
A \approx U_k Sigma_k V^T_k

Included is a blocked randomized routine which computes a so called QB 
decompositon of A such that,  
A \approx Q_k B_k, from which other decompositions may be efficiently computed.

The interpolative decomposition routines return a single or double sided ID of a matrix, 
while the CUR decomposition can decompose a matrix into the form A \approx C U R 
where C and R contain a selection of the columns and rows, respectively of the 
original A.

There are several codes: for single processor (with GNU GSL), multiprocessor 
(with Intel MKL) and GPU (with the CULA library for NVIDIA CUDA capable cards 
and with the NVIDIA cuBLAS library).
A simple implementation in Matlab (or Octave) is also provided for 
illustration purposes. The majority of the algorithms are currently implemented with 
the multi-core Intel MKL and GPU CULA and cuBLAS versions. Dependencies are as follows: 

multi_core_mkl_code : uses MKL for BLAS and LAPACK
nvidia_gpu_cula_code : uses CULA for BLAS and most of LAPACK, MKL for some of LAPACK
nvidia_gpu_cublas_code : uses cuBLAS for BLAS and MKL for LAPACK

In addition, experimental Matlab mex-file support for the multi-core and 
GPU C codes is available with illustrating examples of calling some of the 
multi-core and GPU functions.

These codes were written by Sergey Voronin, 2014-2016 as part of a collaborative project with 
Per-Gunnar Martinsson.
Tested with GSL-1.16, icc/mkl 14.03, cuda 6.5 & 7.5, cula r18. Should also work 
with more recent version of the software. 

Algorithms used based on those originally described in the article: 
"Finding structure with randomness: Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions," N. Halko, P.G. Martinsson, J. Tropp, SIAM Review, 53(2), 2011
and in the other mentioned articles, with some modifications. 
See the arxiv articles for more details.

============ summary of installation and usage ==============

One must install the GNU GSL development libraries, Intel MKL (and the intel C compiler), 
NVIDIA CUDA libraries and the CULA Dense packages. 
Please refer to their corresponding documentations.
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone
http://www.culatools.com/dense/

NOTE on software: The GSL library is free to download and distributed under a GNU license. A free 
version of the CULA dense library is available for download at 
http://www.culatools.com/downloads/ , which includes all the functions 
necessary for RSVDPACK (matrix-matrix and matrix-vector ops, QR, SVD, etc). 
The Intel MKL library is generally available in commercial form. 
The free, non-commercial versions of the Intel MKL library and the 
C++ compiler can be obtained from Intel by qualified users. Please 
see: https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software .  

For simple illustration of the randomized SVD algorithms, see the 
Matlab implementation. Each C implementation resides in its own subfolder 
with a compile.sh file. After 
necessary paths (PATH variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are set for referencing 
gsl, mkl, and cuda/cula, this file 
should be modified to reflect any local system changes and executed to yield the 
driver executable in each case. Paths for mkl are usually set via:
$ source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
For cuda/cula, source the script nvidia_gpu_cula_code/setup_paths.sh after checking 
that the paths are correct for your system.  

In order to make a test matrix, use the provide make_matrix_binary.m script which can be run 
from Octave or Matlab. Note that this script writes a binary matrix file.

Once the matrix is made one can use any of the drivers to compute the low 
rank SVD or the ID and CUR decompositions. Inside the main loop of the programs one 
sets the rank k <= min(nrows,ncols) 
or the tolerance parameter if one of the autorank methods is used.
Additional parameters such as the block size apply to the block randomized methods.

The following functions are provided for SVD, single and double sided ID, and CUR decompositons:

=======================

Notice that for the multiprocessor OpenMP based code, one can control the number of 
threads used via an environmental variable. For instance, in bash type:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
to use 6 threads. You should use as many threads as there are physical cores for 
best results, but the optimal configuration differs for different systems.
