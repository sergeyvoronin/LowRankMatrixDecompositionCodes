RSVDPACK: Implementations of fast randomized algorithms for computing low rank SVD decompositions of a matrix using randomized sampling. Given, a real mxn matrix A and a rank parameter 
k<< min(m,n) (or optionally, a tolerance parameter instead of rank) the routines compute  
U_k, Sigma_k, and V_k
where U_k is mxk, Sigma_k is kxk, and V_k is nxk, such that:
A \approx U_k Sigma_k V^T_k
See the included pdf file (in description/ folder) for a more detailed description.
There are three codes: for single processor (with GNU GSL), multiprocessor 
(with Intel MKL) and GPU (with CULA library for NVIDIA CUDA capable cards).
A simple implementation in Matlab (or Octave) is also provided for illustration purposes.

Tested with GSL-1.16, icc/mkl 14.03, cuda/cula 6.0

============ summary of installation and usage ==============

One must install the GNU GSL development libraries, Intel MKL (and the intel C compiler), 
NVIDIA CUDA libraries and the CULA Dense packages. 
Please refer to their corresponding documentations.
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone
http://www.culatools.com/dense/

For simple illustration of the randomized SVD algorithms, see the Matlab implementation.
Each C implementation resides in its own subfolder with a compile.sh file. After 
necessary paths (PATH variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are set for referencing 
gsl, mkl, and cuda/cula, this file 
should be modified to reflect any local system changes and executed to yield the 
driver executable in each case. Paths for mkl are usually set via:
$ source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
For cuda/cula, source the script nvidia_gpu_cula_code/setup_paths.sh after checking 
that the paths are correct for your system.  

In order to make a test matrix, use the provide make_matrix_binary.m script which can be run 
from Octave or Matlab. Note that this script writes a binary matrix file.

Once the matrix is made one can use any of the drivers to compute the low 
rank SVD. Inside the main loop of the programs one sets the rank k <= min(nrows,ncols) 
or the tolerance parameter if one of the autorank methods is used.

One can call either algorithm I,II, or III for computing the low rank SVD with each driver.
Each of the codes also has three autorank functions based on version II and III 
of the randomized algorithm, for use when a good rank k to use is not known in advance.
Thus, there is a total of 6 functions for computing the low rank SVD.

Sample calling procedure is as follows (similar for all 3 codes).

=======================

// declare matrices
mat *M, *U, *S, *V;

// load matrix M from file
gsl_matrix *M = matrix_load_from_binary_file(mfile);
m = M->nrows; n = M->ncols;

// set svd rank (< min(m,n)) if not using the autorank version
// for autorank, define instead the TOL parameter (i.e. TOL = 0.1)
k = 300;

// call random SVD (use one of the five variants)
randomized_low_rank_svd1(M, k, &U, &S, &V);
randomized_low_rank_svd2(M, k, &U, &S, &V);
randomized_low_rank_svd3(M, k, q, s, &U, &S, &V);
randomized_low_rank_svd2_autorank1(M, frac, TOL, &U, &S, &V);
randomized_low_rank_svd2_autorank2(M, kblocksize, TOL, &U, &S, &V);
randomized_low_rank_svd3_autorank2(M, kblocksize, TOL, q, s, &U, &S, &V);

// write results to disk
matrix_write_to_binary_file(U, "data/U.bin");
matrix_write_to_binary_file(S, "data/S.bin");
matrix_write_to_binary_file(V, "data/V.bin");

=======================

Notice that for the multiprocessor OpenMP based code, one can control the number of 
threads used via an environmental variable. For instance, in bash type:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
to use 6 threads. You should use as many threads as there are physical cores for 
best results, but the optimal configuration differs for different systems.

Example run with GPU code

First, make the matrix
$ matlab -nodesktop
> make_matrix_binary2 
> ls data/A_mat_6kx12k.bin
$

Check to make sure nvidia libs are setup ok:
$ nvidia-smi 

Switch to correct directory
$ cd nvidia_gpu_cula_code 

Source paths to cuda/cula
$ source setup_paths.sh

Compile
$./compile.sh

Run:
$./driver_gpu_nvidia_cula
